<!-- Welcome. -->
## Welcome.

Thank you for stopping by! Please, take a moment to learn more about me and explore the projects I'm currently working on and those I completed during my time at Oregon State University.

As always, **GO BEAVS!**

<!-- Who Am I. -->
## Who am I.

My name is Alex, and I currently live and work in Houston, Texas as an estimator for a contents restoration cleaning company. I graduated from Oregon State University in June 2023 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science while working full-time as a Maintenance Supervisor. Balancing a rigorous academic schedule with a full-time job was no easy task, but I succeeded through my strong work ethic, resilience, and adaptability. These qualities, combined with my goal-oriented attitude and drive to excel, make me a valuable asset to any team.

My professional goal is to start my career as a Python software engineer or a related role. Long-term, I am interested in opportunities in software engineering for industries like computer hardware, restoration software, cloud computing, or cybersecurity. I am eager to learn and adapt, keeping my career aspirations open to any sector where I can grow and contribute meaningfully.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my personal site!

## OSU Computer Science projects.

The following projects showcase the skills and experiences I gained during my Computer Science degree. These include solo and team-based development, utilizing Python, REST APIs, databases, continuous integration, test-driven development, microservices, and agile methodologies.

Each project below links to its respective GitHub repository for more details. 

### Cloud-Deployed REST API with JWT Authentication
For CS 493 - Cloud Application Development
- **Overview**: Built a RESTful API for managing Boat and Load entities on Google Cloud with secure JWT-based authentication via Auth0.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Flask, Google Datastore, OAuth 2.0, Postman.
- **Outcome**: Demonstrated proficiency in building and deploying scalable REST APIs with authentication, resolving challenges in configuring secure endpoints with Flask and Auth0 on Google Cloud Platform.

### Microservices-Based Password Generator and Strength Tester
For CS 361 - Software Engineering I
- **Overview**: Built a PySide6 desktop application to generate passwords and test their strength using microservices.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, PySide6, Qt, Sockets, zxcvbn Library.
- **Outcome**: Resolved interoperability issues between the main application and microservices through applying Agile methodologies for iterative development and team collaboration.

### Golf Tracking Database Administration Web App 
For CS 340 - Introduction to Databases

- **Overview**: Developed a web application for managing golf tracking data, designed for database administrators to perform CRUD operations on players, courses, and game statistics.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Flask, MySQL, Jinja, HTML, CSS.
- **Outcome**: Gained hands-on experience with SQL query optimization, Flask routing, and Jinja templates while addressing schema inconsistencies through iterative design to create a robust relational model for golf statistics.

### Custom Shell with Command Parsing and Process Handling
For CS 344 - Operating Systems
- **Overview**: Developed a UNIX-like shell in C to support command parsing, child process execution, and custom implementations of cd and exit.
- **Tech Stack**: C, UNIX System Calls, Standard C Library, Vim.
- **Outcome**: Overcame challenges in parsing user input and managing concurrent processes while creating interactive CLI tools, reinforcing concepts in UNIX system calls and process management.

### Continuous Integration in Collaborative Python Development 
For CS 362 - Software Engineering II
- **Overview**: Collaborated in a team of three to implement Python functions using Test-Driven Development (TDD) and a Continuous Integration (CI) workflow with GitHub Actions in a shared repository.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, GitHub Actions, unittest, TDD.
- **Outcome**: Gained expertise in integrating CI tools into collaborative workflows while applying TDD, unit testing, and peer-reviewed workflows to deliver high-quality Python functions.

### Low-Level I/O and String Processing MASM Program 
For CS 271 - Computer Architecture and Assembly Language
- **Overview**: Designed and implemented a MASM-style x86-32 program to validate and process user input, perform numeric conversions, and display results using custom macros and string primitives.
- **Tech Stack**: x86-32 Instruction Set, Irvine32 Link Library, Microsoft Macro Assembler
- **Outcome**: Applied advanced assembly language concepts to develop modular I/O procedures and validate numeric data, overcoming challenges in low-level routines and stack-based parameter passing.
