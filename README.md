<!-- Welcome. -->
## Welcome.

Thank you for stopping by! Please, take a moment to learn more about me and explore the projects I'm currently working on and those I completed during my time at Oregon State University.

As always, **GO BEAVS!**

<!-- Who Am I. -->
## Who am I.

My name is Alex, and I currently live and work in Houston, Texas as an estimator for a contents restoration cleaning company. I graduated from Oregon State University in June 2023 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science while working full-time as a Maintenance Supervisor. Balancing a rigorous academic schedule with a full-time job was no easy task, but I succeeded through my strong work ethic, resilience, and adaptability. These qualities, combined with my goal-oriented attitude and drive to excel, make me a valuable asset to any team.

My professional goal is to start my career as a Python software engineer or a related role. Long-term, I am interested in opportunities in software engineering for industries like computer hardware, restoration software, cloud computing, or cybersecurity. I am eager to learn and adapt, keeping my career aspirations open to any sector where I can grow and contribute meaningfully.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my personal site!
