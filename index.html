    <h1>Welcome.</h1>
    <p>
      Thank you for stopping by! Please, take a moment to learn more about me and 
      explore the projects I completed during my time at Oregon State University.
    </p>
    <p>As always, <b style="color: #DC4405;">GO BEAVS!</b></p>
    
    <h2>Who am I.</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Alex, and I currently live in Houston, Texas.  I graduated
      from Oregon State University in June 2023 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer
      Science while working full-time.  Balancing a rigorous academic schedule with a 
      full-time job was no easy task, but I succeeded through my strong work 
      ethic, resilience, and adaptability.  These qualities, combined with my goal
      -oriented attitude and drive to excel, make me a valuable asset to any team.
    </p>
    <p>
      My professional goal is to start my career as a Python software engineer or a 
      related role. Long-term, I am interested in opportunities in software engineering
      for industries like computer hardware, restoration software, cloud computing, or 
      cybersecurity. I am eager to learn and adapt, keeping my career aspirations open 
      to any sector where I can grow and contribute meaningfully.
