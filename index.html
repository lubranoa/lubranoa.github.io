    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I recently graduated from Oregon State University in June 2023 with a BS in
      Computer Science. I worked full-time (and still do) as a Maintenance Supervisor 
      in Houston, Texas, while I was getting this degree as a half-time student, which
      was a difficult time for me. However, I was still able to succeed due to my 
      strong work ethic, resilience, and adaptability. These qualities along with my 
      goal-oriented attitude and desire to succeed would make me a great fit with a 
      vast number of companies and their teams.
    </p>
    <p>
      My professional goals are, first, to become a Python software engineer or 
      something along those lines and, later, to eventually break into software 
      engineering for the computer hardware industry or even the cloud or 
      cybersecurity industries. I am quite adaptable and eager to learn so my
      career aspirations are wide open.
