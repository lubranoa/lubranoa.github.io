    <h1>Welcome.</h1>
    <p>
      Thank you for stopping by! Take a minute to learn a little about me as well as
      the projects from my time at Oregon State.
    </p>
    <p>Also,</p>
    <h1 style="color: #DC4405; text-align: center">GO BEAVS!</h1>
    <h2>Who am I.</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Alex and I currently live in Houston, Texas. I recently graduated
      from Oregon State University in June 2023 with a BS in Computer Science, while 
      also working full-time. Being a half-time student while working was not an easy
      endeavor in the least bit but I was still able to succeed due to my strong work
      ethic, resilience, and adaptability. These qualities along with my goal-oriented
      attitude and desire to succeed would make me a great fit with a vast number of 
      companies and their teams.
    </p>
    <p>
      My professional goals are, first, to become a Python software engineer or 
      something adjacent and, later, to break into software engineering for the 
      Computer Hardware industry or even the Cloud or Cybersecurity industries. I am an
      adaptable individual and am eager to learn, so my career aspirations are wide 
      open to any sector.

    <p>Thank you for taking the time out of your day to check out my personal site!</p>
    <h2>OSU CS Projects.</h2>
    <p>
      These projects showcase some of the experience I have gained from my CS degree.
      Included are ones that involved solo and team development of applications using
      Python, REST APIs and databases, continuous integration and test-driven 
      development, and microservice architectures and agile methodologies. Each project
      below contains a link to their respective GitHub repositories.
