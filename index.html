    <h1>Welome to my personal site.</h1>
    <h2>My Story So Far</h2>
    <p>
      I recently graduated from Oregon State University in June 2023 with a BS in
      Computer Science. I worked full-time (and still do) as a Maintenance Supervisor 
      in Houston, Texas, while I was getting this degree as a half-time student, which
      was quite the difficult endeavor. However, I was still able to succeed due to my 
      strong work ethic, resilience, and adaptability. These qualities along with my 
      goal-oriented attitude and desire to succeed would make me a great fit with a 
      vast number of companies and their teams.
    </p>
    <p>
      My professional goals are, first, to become a Python software engineer or 
      something adjacent and, later, to eventually break into software 
      engineering for the Computer Hardware industry or even the Cloud or 
      Cybersecurity industries. I am an adaptable individual and am eager to 
      learn so my career aspirations are wide open to any sector.
    </p>
