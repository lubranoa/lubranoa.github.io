    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I recently graduated from Oregon State University in June 2023 with a BS in
      Computer Science. I worked full-time (and still do) as a Maintenance Supervisor 
      in Houston, Texas, while I was getting this degree as a half-time student.
    </p>
    <p>
      My professional goals are to become a Python software engineer first and to 
      eventually break into coding for the computer hardware industry or even break
      into cybersecurity.
